# ATS-Postiats-test
This repository is primarily for testing ATS2 on various platforms,
including Linux, OSX, etc.

Everyone is welcome to contribute testing code. The "wilder" the coding
style is, the better. Just make sure that you do not submit code that
loops indefinitely :)

You can easily figure out how to contribute by simply taking a look at the
following directory:
