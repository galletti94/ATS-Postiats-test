# A short note on Enigma
#
######

This is the fundamental mapping behind Enigma:

x -> p^(R^(f(R(p(x)))))

p (plugboard) is the inverse of itself
f (reflector) is the inverse of itself
R (rotor sequence) may not be the inverse of itself

p^ is the inverse of p, which equals p
R^ is the inverse of R, which may not equal R

Let r0 be a rotor.

Let r1 be r0 with its shift set to S. Then we have

r1(x) = r0(x) + S
r1^(x) = r0^(x - S)

where r0^ and r1^ are the inverse mappings of r0 and r1,
respectively.
